## Introduction

Bainbridge et al. (2019) uses a free recall drawing paradigm to investigate the diagnosticity of visual memory for static, real-world scenes. Their results show that participants’ drawings, both immediately and after a delay, could reliably capture object and spatial information.  The study is methodologically rigorous, incorporating drawing, memory, and rating tasks. While replicating the free drawing component is too resource-intensive, it is feasible and worthwhile to recruit new participants on Prolific to complete the drawing-to-picture matching task using the existing drawing dataset, allowing for an assessment of the robustness of the original main effect. If time permits, I plan to conduct a model-based analysis using vision-language models (e.g., CLIP or DeepMeaning) to provide a computational benchmark for alignment with human performance, though that is not the main goal for this project.

The original stimulus set contains 90 scene images, 3 per scene category. These images are selected from validated naturalistic scene image datasets, controlled for memorability and low-level visual features. For the present replication, I will select a subset of the categories that contain images that are appropriate for future extension to developmental studies. Specifically, I will select 15-20 of the original 30 scene categories based on their suitability for children (e.g., playground, bedroom, kitchen, park, zoo), retaining both high-memorable and low-memorable exemplars per category for a total of 30 images that have drawings, and use the original foil in each category to preserve the 3AFC experimental design. 

The target comparison for this replication is the contrast between Delayed Recall drawings and Category Drawings, which is one of the most theoretically important effects demonstrating that memory drawings contain visual information specific to the studied images rather than merely canonical representations of scene categories. In the original study, Delayed Recall drawings were correctly matched to their corresponding images by 84.3% of raters (SD = 10.9%), significantly outperforming Category Drawings at 30.7% (SD = 17.4%), yielding a very large effect size (Cohen's d $\approx$ 3.7). Given this robust effect, I plan to use a conservative power analysis assuming a substantially attenuated effect size of d = 2.0, $\alpha$  = 0.5, and 90% power, which requires only 6 drawings per condition. However, to conserve integrity to the original study, all 60 selected drawings (30 Delayed Recall, 30 Category Drawings) will be rated.

Following the original procedure, each drawing will be presented alongside 3 scene images from the same category (1 target, 2 foils), and raters will judge which image the drawing best represents. To balance statistical power with cost efficiency, I will recruit 10-12 independent raters per drawing (as opposed to 24 in the original study), as the high inter-rater reliability suggests that fewer raters will still provide stable estimates. 12 Prolific participants will complete approximately 60 trials each.

## Methods

### Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

### Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

### Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Procedure	

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

### Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
